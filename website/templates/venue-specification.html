                    Theatres
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    The layout of each Situ Live venue is based on a series of theatres. Each theatre is designed by the Situ Live expert design team to suit a lifestyle theme.
                  </p>
                  <h4>

                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    On occasions Situ Live will refit the fixtures and fittings, graphics, lighting, displays and experiential props to suit changing lifestyle tastes, seasonal features or to maintain repeat visitors’ interest. Refit plans can be reviewed on request.
                  </p>
                  <h4>

                  <p>
                    Situ Live will provide first line support for the demo units – checking that the device/appliance is operational, connected and maintained in accordance with the operational manual.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Each demo unit will be merchandised with product name, branding and a unique QR code. The QR code will be connected to the online Product Detail page to enable a seamless connection for visitors and/or advisers to understand and purchase the product.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All logos must be consistent in format, size, and a single neutral colour. We will work with brand identity teams to ensure compliancy with the brand’s guidelines.
                  </p>
                  <h3>
                    Digital Services
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    We use digital services to:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Attract consumers online and potential future visitors</li>
                    <li>To bring the experience of Situ Live to our online audience</li>
                    <li>To provide a different style of product information that focuses on how visitors will use products and a clearer understanding of features</li>
                    <li>To enable the path to purchase so shoppers can seamlessly connect with D2C brand stores or online retailers to make purchases</li>
                    <li>To create engaged Situ Live consumers that we build a relationship with beyond their visit to us – whether that is physically in a venue or via one of our digital channels.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Situ Live digital services will be available across a range of interfaces on web, mobile and voice. At launch visitors will have access to the Situ Live web app at situlive.com. 
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    Venue visitors’ path to purchase
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    Shoppers to the venue will be able to access the web app in several ways:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>They can visit the website on their own mobile device (the same as any online user)</li>
                    <li>Next to each demo unit in the venue will be a QR code. Using their own mobile device, they can use their camera app to scan the QR code to find out more about the product, get prices or link to purchase</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    The content within the web app follows a similar structure to the layout of the venue and is designed around lifestyle themes. Shoppers can browse and search themes, brands and products to understand more about the products and connect with brands/retailers to purchase.
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    Digital directory and store
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    Included within the subscription plan is entry in the Situ Live digital directory and store. This is a Situ Live curated collection of the best in lifestyle brands, technology products and services that help people lead a better life. The collection will include the leading brands in respected categories along with many interesting new products from smaller innovative companies. To ensure continuity with our trusted advisor status some brands listed will not feature in Situ Live venues and will be competitors within your category.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The collection will include all chosen in situ demo units alongside additional products that the Situ Live team may curate from the brand’s range that meet the Situ Live product criteria and are currently available to purchase from a D2C brand store and/or UK retailers. This will only be a curated selection from a brand’s range and not the entire brand’s range.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The inclusion of these products is based on their availability to purchase and will change frequently. If there are specific models a brand wish to exclude they can supply the details and these will be removed from the Situ Live store.
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                   ‘See it in Situ Live’ highlight
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    When visitors browse the digital store, any product(s) that are available as demo units within a Situ Live venue will be highlighted and promoted so that it is clear to visitors that they can get a real-life demonstration of this product in situ.
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    Leads to brand store
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    Shoppers can view pricing for products. Prices and availability are sourced from retailer feeds where available. Brands can supply a price feed for products from their own brand store. Pricing will appear as a featured brand store and can include additional benefit text supplied by the brand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Shoppers can click through to the retail product detail page to view more detailed specification information and to complete a purchase.

                  <h4>
                    Customised brand pillar page
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    In addition to including products in the Situ Live online catalogue we will customise a brand ‘pillar’ page for the brand. A pillar page is a page dedicated to the brand. The page will display information about the Situ Live venue location and details/links of the demo unit products on display. The pillar page can be used as a destination page into Situ Live for the brand. We will customise the hero image and include branding.
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    Conversion assets for D2C stores
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    Digital assets will be available to allow our partners to include a ‘See it in Situ Live’ button/banner alongside products in their D2C brand store – this can aid conversion of visitors who come direct to the D2C brand store but are unlikely to buy without seeing and experiencing the product. The button/banner can link to the brand pillar page or the pillar page content can be delivered as headless content to be displayed within the D2C store.
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    Analytics dashboard
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    Track performance and measure success from one central dashboard. The subscription plan gives a number of users access to a personalised analytics dashboard providing  insight into how visitors have engaged with the brand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The dashboard reports on the visitor numbers within the venue and the nominated theatre, visibility and engagement with stories and products and the number of leads to retailers.  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Every visitor interaction in the venue and online is tracked and recorded in compliance with GDPR. The Situ Live Data Science team transform this data into the analytics dashboard.

                    Situ Live will biannually review with brands the story demo units and where necessary the brand will supply suitable replacements. Situ Live will adjust any content that may be affected by the change.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At other times if a story demo unit becomes permanently unavailable to purchase in the UK or the Situ Live product experts are aware that the model of a story demo unit is out-of-date, we will request a suitable replacement to be supplied. Situ Live will adjust any content that may be affected by the change.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Any requests made by a brand to change story demo units for other reasons or outside the biannual review will be considered but may be subject to additional cost.
                  </p>
